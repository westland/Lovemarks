Files to accompany 'Building Lovemarks with Social Media Marketing'

This study replicates and expands (Fetais et al. 2023) with full-information methods. (Fetais et
al. 2023) investigates the relationship between social media marketing activities (SMMa), community engagement, emotional brand attachment (Lovemark), and brand loyalty in the context
of luxury fashion brands. Guided by Lovemark Theory, Service-Dominant Logic Theory, and
Brand Equity Theory, the research addresses two primary questions: (1) How does SMMa influence community engagement, brand loyalty, and Lovemark? (2) How do community engagement
and Lovemark mediate the relationship between SMMa and brand loyalty? A survey with 11,398
valid responses from a broad demographic was obtained and analyzed using both limited and fullinformation SEM. Results reveal that while SMMa significantly impacts community engagement
and Lovemark, its direct effect on brand loyalty is non-significant. However, both community engagement and Lovemark significantly enhance brand loyalty, demonstrating their critical roles as
mediators. These findings highlight the importance of designing social media strategies that foster interactive, community-driven experiences and emotional connections. The study contributes
to theory by integrating emotional and communal constructs into digital branding models and
offers practical insights for luxury brands seeking to enhance loyalty. Future research should explore these dynamics in broader contexts, leveraging emerging technologies and diverse consumer
segments to deepen understanding.
